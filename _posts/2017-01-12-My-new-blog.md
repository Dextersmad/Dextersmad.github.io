My new blog

This lesson was solely based on getting my blog up and ready. So I had to start from the very beginning. I had to fork someone's programming and then make it my own I changed the name, the description and the background. This took me along time because it didn't work a lot of the time but I kept trying and it finally worked. So my next challenge was trying to get all my blog posts not my blog website. And I still haven't quite got it. But at home I tried to figure out my problems but i couldn't put what was the problem so I sent an email to my teacher if we could talk about it.
