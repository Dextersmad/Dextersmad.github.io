This is my code that i have stated this term and this was the first code that i had created and now we have started a new project ware we will being creating a questionnaire. And this will be the next big thing.

Last lesson we talked about how we could create a questionnaire using numbers so we came up with theory that we could count points for each question and then at the end there would be ranges that we could count and then we would find out what there favourite thing was. However i have gone with a different method ware i am counting how many times they answered a single type of answer and then i will count at the end of how many of that type of answer they answered and then we will now what there favourite thing is.

Next week we are going to start writing the code and i am looking forward to that.
