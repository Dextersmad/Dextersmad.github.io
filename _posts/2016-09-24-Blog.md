In today's lesson me and my friend managed to finish off An entire section of our booklet we really enjoyed it and we also wrote some code of the length of 19 lines of code. We were really proud of ourselves and we have taken this section and really learnt and taken something out of it we are really looking forward to our next section which is titled string theory.

I believe we are really progressing in learning how to code and I can not wait for next lesson.
