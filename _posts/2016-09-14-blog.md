I had a very enjoyable time in y7 IT i learned a lot of things for example coding was very fun and playing on the coding games was very fun. And i am looking forward to another good year of IT in yr 8

In our first IT lesson we plugged in fuse boxes to our monitors and we are starting a new type of programming in pairs on a fuse box this should be a pretty interesting year.
