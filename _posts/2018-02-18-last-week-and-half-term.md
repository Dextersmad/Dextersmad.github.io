    <td>This project was to create a buzzfeed quiz for a topic and i did it for movie genres. I used all of my other knowledge of coding to create this final code and also help from my teacher and friends. I had to use loops and functions to create this code. I also had to use symbols to find out what your final result would be.</td>
