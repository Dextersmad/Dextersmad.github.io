  <tr>
    <td>During this Half term we looked at google sheets and how to use it to our advantage. By making boxes refer to other boxes we limited the amount of work we had to do and that was really cool because we could make up our own code and not have to encode or decipher it. We used different spread sheets which cleared our work and made it look neat while keeping the code working and that was really effective.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Techniques we used  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We used a technique called split which is where u split up the word into numbers so it is easy to refer to them and the software knows what to look for and it gives it a number and we have to remember that sheets works in numbers. This is also why we numbered our alphabet so that the program knew that every letter had a value. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what i have achieved?why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have achieved a basic understanding of google sheets and how it works and how we can use it to our advantage. I have also achieved a better logical thinking pattern because alot of IT is just logic like looking back at a certain cell which refers to a number u need and then after that i have learnt what u need to add to let sheets understand what i am trying to do. I think i have achieved a lot because i can use sheets and that is what i wanted to do during this half term.</td>
