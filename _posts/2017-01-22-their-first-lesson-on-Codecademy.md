    <td>At the very beginning we were told that we must read everything and i tried to do that and i found that i was getting things done and understanding it but i was going at a very slow pace. So i found that if you skimmed everything then it is better because you absorb all of the information as well as moving at a healthy pace. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the only thing that limited my learning is my understanding of coding at the beginning when i didn't know how to interpret the way they explained things to me but hopefully in the future i will learn to understand what they are telling me quicker and easier.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve by not just copying the code from the side bar i will try and use my initiative this will hopefully expand my understanding for coding and i will benefit from this greatly.</td>
