    <td>After my first lesson of codecademy I found it really interesting so doing it for homework was not such a problem so i tried to keep that same type of mentality. I managed to do my target but I think that I could have doubled that if i had focused and didn't messed around but what I found was effective was the skimming of the text that I mentioned in my last blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that the only thing that limited my learning was the messing around I did, if i focused I could have done so much better. What I also need to do is double check everything that I write because I found that when I started to gain speed I made mistakes which slowed me down. </td>
