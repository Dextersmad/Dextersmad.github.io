Monster coding

Today was a very eventful day we completed 2 new sections in our adventure to be amazing coders we started of with a monster code of 31 lines it created a very nice conversation and we were happy with our result but my favourite bit of the lesson was when we used binary to create our own invader this was really fun because we ended up with the sign saying I love invaders this was really good because we learnt how to use  different colours this was a very good lesson and I am still loving learning to code and we are about to start learning how to make it use previously information to create a new path we have coded in.
