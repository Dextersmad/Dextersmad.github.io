Another very good lesson

In today's lesson we carried on using the fuse boxes me and Luke Rich were very quick at setting up our fuse box but when we tried to do our first activity we struggled because after we learned how to repeat a few words over and over again it would come up as an error but then we figured out if we saved it then we are able to do it.

 

During the last few minutes of the lesson we really enjoyed using our fuse box and playing around with each the colours and text. We are looking forward to our next lesson and we are going to have a good time in our next activity.
