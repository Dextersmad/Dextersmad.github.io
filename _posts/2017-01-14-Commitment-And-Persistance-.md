    <td>In today's lesson we were told that our mental strategies we're wrong because we we’re thinking in a way that only people who should not succeed think we have been thinking that if anything is too hard then we give up. We we’re shown a video about a boy who couldn’t jump over a stack of boxes and that help us realize that although he did not manage the first time he was told to do it again and again at this point the boy was crying but what was nice was that none of the boys we’re laughing at him they were only encouraging him. And i think that this was an effective way to teach us because it gave an example of failure and then success. After that we were told the difference between DCGS and that japanese school and the difference was the level of effort that they put in and the level of encouragement. After that the whole mentality of the lesson changed i think that everyone was really quite shocked about how they acted. After that we started talking about binary and hex and that although they seem very confusing and the math you have to do is difficult if you want to change inbetween them it is not all that hard. In Hex there are letters A-F and each one of them have a number given to them for example F=15. So all you have to do is use your binary technique of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 then 16, 32 and so on. I think the simplicity of the technique appealed to our slacking side of us.And that kind of help us learn. By then we had run out of time and told the homework which he told us that he wanted to see some change.</td>

    <td>I think that the only thing limited my learning was my attitude to learning i don't think that i thought enough and contributed. I think that my contribution levels are way to low and my effort levels are way to low. I think that if i want to improve i need to start by getting more involved and after that i will start to enjoy the subject more because i will have a higher understanding of the subject. But i do think that after the commitment i have had to restart my blog this week and try and make my blogs more detailed and less boring things will turn around i will start to be more proud of my blogs instead of annoyed by it. I have also learned that if i miss a lesson that it can not be used as an excuse to miss out on homework but only a reason  to have tried harder with catch up and talk to more people about things i can do.</td>
