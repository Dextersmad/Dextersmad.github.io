Making good progress

This weeks lessons sea bit of a struggle at start but afterwards I think me and my friend really advanced in the booklet. At the beginning of the lesson I tried to figure out how to fix my blog but that did not go to well. I started to carry on with the programming me and my friend did a monster program of around 20 lines we did understand it quite well and I think that I am making good progress in programming because when I read through the program I can tell all the detail and I can figure out if there are any problems with our program very quickly meaning it helps us get through our program faster than other groups. I am still really liking programming and I am glad we are continuing.
