  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson we started off with ways we could complete this project and i used the simple way because i understood it more using loops we were able to ask 5 questions and then return answers although this doesn't sound like a lot it was a big step to finishing the project because now i have the structure to then add all of the little things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was me not understanding the complicated way and that meant that i couldn't progress in my learning. I need to learn about functions and processes and the differences between them this will help me progress with this project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will talk more in class so that i can ask more questions and then i will find it easier to complete the tasks i am asked to. And i will also look at the differences between functions and processes so that i am ready for next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
