    <td>This week i tried reading the text that is given to u and then trying the first thought that came into my head and i found some successful results because i felt i was remembering the things i had done in the last exercise and that meant i understood everything very quickly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing i that limited my learning the most was other people asking me questions because i was quite ahead i didn't mind helping but i did slow me down a bit so i should limit how many people i help every lesson and maybe i won't get as distracted as i did last time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time hopefully i will break the 40 mark and try and get to the top of the class and then i would be doing very well. And to do that i have decided to do as much codecademy i can in my spare time.</td>
