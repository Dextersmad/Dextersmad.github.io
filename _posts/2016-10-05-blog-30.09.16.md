A different type of IT lesson

In today's lesson we did not really make any huge steps in our fuse box quest because this lesson i particularly struggled getting my blog to upload all my blogs so i spent quite a while trying to get it to work but in the end it turned out that my blog was out of date and i was supposed to get a new one at the beginning of the term this meant that all the things i learnt last year and all the steps it took for me to set up my blog would have to be done again i really struggled with this so i asked my friend who was having the same problems to help me this then took quite a while because he could not remember and after all my trying my blog would still not work but when i was about to ask the teacher about it it was the end of the lesson. This was very annoying but i do plan on talking to my teacher again last lesson

but besides  trying to get my blog to work the only thing that was really talked about was how most of the names of our blogs were very boring and that if we really wanted to get people to read our blogs we must come up with interesting names that people could say that since they read the title they really wanted to read the blog. This was not a very fun lesson but it did make me realize that if i pay attention it might help me in future times.

This might not even reach you until a little while later
