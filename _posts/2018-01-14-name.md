  <tr>
    <td>I used templates that the teacher gave me to help me understand how to use them and then i had instructions and i had to use the skills i had learnt to follow the instructions and make my own code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that made it harder for me is that i am still getting used to python and simple knowledge that i should know. And if i do this then i will understand everything more than before because i know what i am typing.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time i will look back at old code and i will try to make links between old code and new code and this will develop my understanding.</td>
