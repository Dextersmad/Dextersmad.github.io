    <td>This section required a lot of skills because the instruction box got less and less descriptive so instead of reading and just figure out the code we had to try and understand the parts it wasn't telling us. And that was very challenging because when you have gotten used to very descriptive instructions the change comes as quite a shock and adapting was hard.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning this lesson was the person sitting next to me got hacked and that took my attention a bit so i spent a fair bit of time either helping him or listening to the conversation he was having with the teacher so that occurrence limited the amount of work i was doing. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time instead of getting distracted i will carry on focusing on my own work and try to not lose the momentum and i will also try try to think about the text i will read above the instructions because later on that will make a big difference on how i am moving and the pace i am going at.</td>
