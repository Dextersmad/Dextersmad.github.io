    <td>In this lesson i had moved on to putting all of what we had learned into a few final codes i had started to look at different paths of coding for  example if i said how old are you and then they said a number 50+ then the code would you are old but if was a number lower than 50 it would say you are very young. Asking my friends for clues was a very good strategy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that the only thing that limited my learning was my memory i struggled to remember how to do things so trying to proceed was very hard. I need to work on my memory.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will work on my actual understanding of the coding and try to think of ways i can remember things like actions to minus things and add things and other functions.</td>
