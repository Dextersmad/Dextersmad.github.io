A good blog post

In today's lesson we did something different we looked at the the differences between a good blog post and a bad blog post. We figured out that a good blog post is not talking to the teacher but for everyone to read. I think this lesson will be a really big help because it will make a huge difference to not just mine but everyone's work and i am going to look at writing blogs in a different way not just as a homework but something interesting and an interesting thing to do. But after looking at some examples of good and bad blogs we looked at the marking scheme in which the teachers would mark our work this really developed my understanding on how to get myself a better mark and a better looking website.

So I will try to improve my writing and also develop my lesson descriptions with opinions and struggles we may have faced along the way instead of listing what we did which would come across as very boring. I will also reread all of my blogs to make sure there are no silly errors or spelling mistakes. 

I am looking forward to how all of these new techniques improve and develop my website for the better.
