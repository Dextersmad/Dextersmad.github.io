    <td>Today we had a different teacher and for this lesson we were having a one off lesson on compression  which we did in google sheets. We started off with a picture and we coloured in a certain amount of boxes in different colours and then we had to copy out the letter of the colours in the same order next to the image so that someone else could come along and recreate this image. The point of this was to create a perfect recreatable image easily. And I managed to do that quite easily. Finally the last thing that we did was figure out how much we had magnified the picture from the code on the right and we did that by finding the area of each side and then minusing them to find the difference then you made that into a percentage.</td>
