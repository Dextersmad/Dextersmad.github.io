    <td>During this half term we have been using excel which is a website which uses coding you can make all kinds of cool things like tables which figure out averages by themselves. We have been using this to create a code that shuffles up the alphabet so that it becomes a code. What we did was put a long significant word at the beginning of the alphabet and that jumbled up the alphabet we came across a struggle tho because at the end the letters at the end matched up to the originals which made the code less efficient. And we are now working on a code that recreates words into the code so that we don't have to figure it out by ourselves it will just translate it as soon as we input it into the boxes. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think the only thing i need to do is ask more questions so that i can further my learning quicker and i can experiment so that i can become better. If i did this i think that i could understand what i am doing further  and i could write my own code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will ask more questions so that when it comes to independent work i can keep on working without having to ask anyone and i could take it to the next level without the teacher explaining it to me. </td>
